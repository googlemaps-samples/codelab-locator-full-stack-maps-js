# Full Stack Store Locator

These are the resource files needed for the [Build a full stack store locator](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/full-stack-store-locator/)
codelab from Google.

## Introduction for the [Build a full stack store locator](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/full-stack-store-locator/) codelab

Imagine you have many places to put on a map and you want users to be able to see where these places are and identify which place they want to visit. Common examples of this include:
* a store locator on a retailer's website
* a map of polling locations for an upcoming election
* a directory of specialty locations such as battery recycling receptacles

In this codelab, you will create a locator that draws from a live data feed of specialized locations and helps the user find the location nearest their starting point. This full-stack locator can handle much larger numbers of places than the [simple store locator](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/google-maps-simple-store-locator), which is limited to 25 or fewer store locations.
